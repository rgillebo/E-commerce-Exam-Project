## SETUP
### Prerequisites 

Before setting up the project, make sure the following is installed: 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- [MySQL Installer (Version 8.0.37)](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html)
- When installing choose the custom option, and select the 'MySQL Server 8.0 & MySQL Workbench 8.0'
- A inital connection will have to be made for the database and table creation to work on app start, here is a step by step guide: 
1. Open MySQL workbench
2. Connect to MySQL with the default connection, or create your own
3. Follow steps in [Database Setup](#database-setup) and [Database Access](#database-access)
---
### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/rgillebo/E-commerce-Exam-Project
cd E-commerce-Exam-Project

``` 

2. Install dependencies 

```
npm install
```
---
### Database Setup
To create the database for the web application run the following SQL script in MySQL workbench: 

``` 
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS noroff_e_commerce; 
```
---
### Database Access 

To setup the database access, the following SQL script can be used: 

```
CREATE USER 'EP1Admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'P@ssword2023';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON noroff_e_commerce.* TO 'EP1Admin'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

--- 

### Environment Variables
Create a '.env' file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables: 

```
JWT_SECRET=c0a816e4321404618d4249054a2378c70b460bc00843f418539fa64ef9e5b4af8e4ec674921686abd216366002b4d81112c77734084ccf8001e8faef2dc6f1ed
DATABASE_NAME=noroff_e_commerce
DATABASE_USER=EP1Admin
DATABASE_PASSWORD=P@ssword2023
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
``` 
--- 

## USAGE

### Running the server
1. Start the server: 

``` 
npm start
```
The server will start on '[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)' 

---

### Initial database population
1. Initialze the database from the API: 

   - Navigate to '[http://localhost:3000/utility/init](http://localhost:3000/utility/init)' to populate the database with initial data from the API, roles and an admin user.

   - This can also be achieved through sending a POST request through postman with the same endpoint. 

--- 

### Admin interface

- Login: Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/admin/login](http://localhost:3000/admin/login) and log in using the admin credentials.


---



## TESTING

1. For the test to run as intended, a user with the credentials listed in the [auth.test.js](/tests/auth.test.js) must be created. This can be done through the [routes/users.js](/routes/users.js) endpoint of /register which is setup with the correct credentials. 

2. To run tests, use the following command: 

```
npm test
```
